# A.I.R.drop - A Sonic 3 A.I.R. Mod Installer
A.I.R.drop is a tool that allows gamers to quickly browse, download, and install mods for Sonic 3 A.I.R. The aim for it is to make installing mods a much better quality of life experience.

## Prerequisites
Do note that this application is Windows only. When you first open the exe, you'll get a message saying to install .NET 8 Desktop Runtime if you don't already have it installed. Please do so if that's the case.

## Installing Mods
There are 2 methods of doing this:
1. Using the application to browse and download mods found on GameBanana
2. Using 1-click install buttons from browsing mods directly from the GameBanana website
These 2 methods will directly download the mod files into your AppData Sonic 3 AIR mods folder.

## FAQ
### Is this safe? My antivirus is getting set off.
Yes this application is safe. Antivirus tends to trigger false alarms, especially due to it needing to be connected to the internet in order to be compatible with 1-click installations and updating. You can check out the source code for yourself if you're suspicious of anything as well.

### Why won’t A.I.R.drop open?
I made it so only one instance is running at a time so if it’s already running, the app won’t open. Check to see if you can end the process in task manager or even restart your PC if you don’t know how to do that.
